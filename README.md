# About the R Superhero Project

# The project was completed and the code was written by me, with the central problem presented to us from our professor in my Data Exploration and Visualization course (MATH 3440).
# I recevied an A for this project

# The project was based off of a fictional Superhero talent agency wanting information about Superhero's following a fictional data leak.
